# Python Flask App to present finn.no data.

This app uses the data stored by #finnazureflaskapp. On load, it queries the Azure Storage Blob for data and presents a 
graphical representation. It also shows the overall data collected from finn in the tables below. 

Work In Progress:
Plan is to add some filter and search that can be used by the user.
